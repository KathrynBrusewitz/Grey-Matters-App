## Running the app

After cloning the repo and navigating to the directory in your terminal, run `npm install` to install all the packages the project depends on. If you don't have npm installed, download it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Install the [Expo Command-Line Interface](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/exp-cli.html) by running the command `npm install -g exp`.

The Grey Matters app is designed and optimized to run on iOS. To run it on your device, go to the App Store and dowload the Expo Client app. Next, back in the terminal, run the command `exp start --send-to XXXXXXXXXX`, replacing XXXXXXXXXX with your phone number or email address. This will send you a link that you can open in your phone to open up the application.

## Technology Decisions

I chose to build this app with React Native because se I was already familiar with JavaScript and React and didn't feel that I could learn a whole new language and development environment as well as build the whole app in the 10 weeks we had for this project. Using React Native will also make it easier to potentially expand the app to the Android platform in the future.
