    title: 'Whole Brain', 
    image: require('../../images/whole_brain.png'),
    description: 'The brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Forebrain',
    image: require('../../images/forebrain.png'), 
    description: 'The forebrain consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Midbrain',
    image: require('../../images/midbrain.png'),
    description: 'The midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Hindbrain',
    image: require('../../images/hind_brain.png'),
    description: 'The hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons, and medulla. Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred together as the brainstem.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Cerebrum',
    image: require('../../images/cerebrum.png'),
    description: 'The cerebrum (or cerebral cortex) is the largest part of the brain and is associated with higher brain functions such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four section or lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Frontal Lobe',
    image: require('../../images/frontal_lobe.png'),
    description: 'The frontal lobe is associated with reason, planning, parts of speech, movement, emotions, and problem solving.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Parietal Lobe',
    image: require('../../images/parietal_lobe.png'),
    description: 'The parietal lobe is associated with movement, orientation, recognition, and perception of stimuli.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Occipital Lobe',
    image: require('../../images/occipital_lobe.png'),
    description: 'The occipital lobe is associated with visual perception.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Temporal Lobe',
    image: require('../../images/temporal_lobe.png'),
    description: 'The temporal lobe is associated with perception and recognition of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Cerebrum',
    image: require('../../images/cerebrum.png'),
    description: 'The cerebrum is highly wrinkled, with the deepest furrow dividing the brain in half to form the left and right hemispheres.',
  },  
  {
    title: 'Corpus Callosum',
    image: require('../../images/corpus_callosum.png'),
    description: 'The corpus callosum is the bundle of axons that connect the two halves.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Cerebellum',
    image: require('../../images/cerebellum.png'),
    description: 'The cerebellum (or little brain) is similar to the cerebrum in that it has two hemispheres and has a wrinkly surface. This structure is associated with the regulation and coordination of movement, posture, and balance.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Limbic System',
    image: require('../../images/limbic_system.png'),
    description: 'The limbic system is often referred to as the “emotional brain” and is buried within the cerebrum. This structure contains the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Thalamus',
    image: require('../../images/thalamus.png'),
    description: 'The thalamus acts as the switchboard center with almost all sensory information entering it before being relayed to the necessary structure.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Hypothalamus',
    image: require('../../images/hypothalamus.png'),
    description: 'The hypothalamus is involved in functions including homeostasis, emotion, thirst, hunger, circadian rhythms, and the control of the autonomic nervous system.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Amygdala',
    image: require('../../images/amygdala.png'),
    description: 'The amygdala is associated with memory, emotion, and fear.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Hippocampus',
    image: require('../../images/hippocampus.png'),
    description: 'Finally, the hippocampus is involved in learning and memory.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Brain Stem',
    image: require('../../images/brainstem.png'),
    description: 'The brain stem is under the limbic system and is responsible for the basic vital life functions of breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. This is made of the midbrain, pons, and medulla.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Midbrain',
    image: require('../../images/midbrain.png'),
    description: 'The midbrain is involved in vision, hearing, eye movement, and body movement.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Pons',
    image: require('../../images/pons.png'),
    description: 'The pons is involved in motor control and sensory analysis, while also having a significant role in our level of consciousness and sleep patterns.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Medulla',
    image: require('../../images/medulla.png'),
    description: 'The medulla is responsible for maintaining vital body functions such as breathing and a steady heartbeat.',
  },
